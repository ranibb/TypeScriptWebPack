## Sets

* A Set is a data structure which contains a list of values that are unique.
* You can add strings, numeric and objects to a set using the add method.
* Objects added to the set are not converted to strings.
* We can initialize values using an array during the creation of a set.
* we can chain the add method to add elements to a set.
* To check for existence of a value in a set we use the has method.
* To delete a value from a set we use the delete method.
