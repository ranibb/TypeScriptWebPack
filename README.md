## Generators
* Once a function starts executing it will always run to completion before any other code can run. However, Generators is a special type of function which can be paused in the middle of execution and run other code and then resume the same function from where we left off.
* This pausing of execution possible with the help of a new keyword called `yield'.
* The syntax of a generator is very much like a function but with an asterisk before the function name.
