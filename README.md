# TypeScript with Webpack

Typescript playground

## Declarations and Annotations
* A very important concept that applies in TypeScript is type inference.
* We can explicitly specify the type of a variable using annotations.
* The initialization is not mandotory.
* A variable declared using `any` Type can hold a numeric, string, boolean, null or undefined.
* A variable declared using `enum` Type. Enumeration are simply used to give friendlier names to numeric values and create a specific type for a variable.
* TypeScript provide `tuples` which are special arrays that let you specify the type the array can contain.
